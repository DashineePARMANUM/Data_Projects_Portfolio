# Data Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Projects Portfolio, here you will be able to redirect to most of the projects i've worked on. most of them are self-decreted.

## About

As a Statistics undergraduate, I wanted to complement my university coursework by focusing on real-world data projects and sharpening industry-relevant skills. 

Even after completing them, I continue to refine these projects, finding small mistakes, rewording explanations, and tweaking code in an effort to perfect my work and deepen my understanding.
