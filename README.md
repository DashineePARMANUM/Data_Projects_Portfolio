# Data Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Projects Portfolio! Here, you can explore most of the projects I've worked on, many of which are self-directed.

## About

As a Statistics undergraduate, I wanted to complement my university coursework by focusing on real-world data projects and sharpening industry-relevant skills.  

Even after completing them, I continue to refine these projects, finding small mistakes, rewording explanations, and tweaking code in an effort to perfect my work and deepen my understanding

## Projects Overview
Below is a snapshot of some of my key projects. Each project folder contains a description, datasets, code/scripts, visualizations, and a report.
