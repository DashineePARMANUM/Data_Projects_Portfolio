# Data Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Projects Portfolio! Here, you can explore most of the projects I've worked on, many of which are self-directed.

## About

As a Statistics undergraduate, Iâ€™ve worked on a mix of coursework-based and self-directed projects to apply my learning to real-world problems and sharpen industry-relevant skills.

Even after completing them, I continue to refine these projects, finding small mistakes, rewording explanations, and tweaking code in an effort to perfect my work and deepen my understanding.
